The color of the text which was resulted from the conﬂict is resolved after we use git push command line locally. It will force to overwirte the remote changes which is red colour with the local changes which is green colour.



The ﬁnal color of the text after resetting and pulling changes is darkolivegreen. After we use git pull or git push command line, any discrepancies with prior versions whatever it is at remote or local folder would finally be resolved, ensuring consistency with the expected design specifications.



1. Create A new Branch: Under this new branch, change some content at index.html and commit it. Then push the changes to the remote repository. 2. Create conflict: Firstly, go back to main, then change some content at the same file in VSCode and push the change to remote repository again. 3. Resolve the conflict by VSCode: There will be a Merge Editor tab popped out when you open the VSCode. Use it to choose the current change or incoming change to complete merge.
